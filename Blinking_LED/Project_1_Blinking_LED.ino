// Project 1: Blinking LED
// This is the "Hello, World!" of the Arduino world.
// It simply blinks the built-in LED on the Arduino board.

// The setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // Initialize the digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  // LED_BUILTIN is a constant that is the number of the pin connected to the on-board LED.
  // Most Arduino boards have this LED connected to pin 13.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// The loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // Wait for a second
}
